**JAVA SCRIPT FUNCTIONS CODE CHALLENGE**

**INTRODUCTON;**
This is a JavaScript code that contains three functions, a grade generator,a speed detector and a salary calculator.
The functions receive input from the user and provide relevant output. 
Below is a brief description of each function:


**Grade generator;**
The grade generator function receives a value between 0-100 and returns the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:

A: 80-100
B: 60-79
C: 50-59
D: 40-49
E: 0-39

The function is triggered when the user clicks on the get grade button on the webpage. The function takes the user input from the input field and returns the corresponding grade.



**Speed detector;**
The speed detector function receives a value for speed and returns a value  based on the following criteria:


If the speed is 70 or below, the output is "Ok".
If the speed is above 70, the demerit points are calculated using the formula (speed - 70) / 5.
If the demerit points are less than 12, the output is the number of demerit points.
If the demerit points are 12 or more, the output is "License suspended".


This function is triggered when the user clicks on the points button on the webpage.The function takes the user's input from the input field and returns the 
value.

The salary calculator function receives a value for gross salary and calculates the net salary after deducting PAYE tax, NHIF, and NSSF.

PAYE tax:
10% of the gross salary if the gross salary is less than or equal to 24000.
25% of the gross salary if the gross salary is greater than 24000 but less than or equal to 32333.
30% of the gross salary if the gross salary is greater than 32333.




NHIF:
150 for gross salary less than or equal to 5999.
300 for gross salary between 6000 and 7999.
400 for gross salary between 8000 and 11999.
500 for gross salary between 12000 and 14999.
600 for gross salary between 15000 and 19999.
750 for gross salary between 20000 and 24999.
850 for gross salary between 25000 and 29999.
900 for gross salary between 30000 and 34999.
950 for gross salary between 35000 and 39999.
1000 for gross salary between 40000 and 44999.
1100 for gross salary between 45000 and 49999.
1200 for gross salary between 50000 and 59999.
1300 for gross salary between 60000 and 69999.
1400 for gross salary between 70000 and 79999.
1500 for gross salary between 80000 and 89999.
1600 for gross salary between 90000 and 99999.
